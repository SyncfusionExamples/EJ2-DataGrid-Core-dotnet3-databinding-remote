# EJ2-Grid-Core-dotnet3-databinding-remote

## Repository Description

This repository contains an ASP.NET Core 3 sample application that demonstrates rendering the EJ2 DataGrid component with remote data binding. The project focuses on server-side data integration and grid rendering using the Syncfusion EJ2 library.

## Project Overview

The application illustrates the usage of the EJ2 Grid within a .NET Core 3 framework. Data is retrieved from a remote source and bound to the grid at runtime. The sample highlights the interaction between the controller and the client-side grid component, making it suitable for understanding remote data scenarios in enterprise web applications.

## Features

- EJ2 Grid integration with ASP.NET Core 3
- Remote data binding through server endpoints
- Initial grid rendering with server-provided data
- Minimal and clean configuration setup

## Prerequisites

- .NET Core SDK 3.x
- Visual Studio 2019 or later
- Basic understanding of ASP.NET Core MVC
- EJ2 dependencies referenced in the project

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to the local system.
    ```
    git clone <repo_link>
    ```
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Restore NuGet packages to resolve required dependencies.
4. Verify that EJ2 references are properly configured.

## Application Running Steps

1. Open the project solution in Visual Studio.
2. Select the appropriate startup project.
3. Build the solution to ensure successful compilation.
4. Run the application using IIS Express or Kestrel.
5. Open the browser to view the EJ2 Grid populated with remote data.

## Usage

When the application starts, the grid requests data from the configured server endpoint. The response is processed and displayed within the EJ2 Grid component.
